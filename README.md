## How to Use These Skins in GamepadViewer

   - Choose any of the PNG images you see in the list above.  
   - Click on the file name to open it.

2. **Get the Direct Image Link**  
   - Once the image preview loads, right-click on the image and select **"Open image in new tab"** (or similar, depending on your browser).  
   - Copy the **URL** from the new tab.  
   - Make sure the URL ends in `.png`.

3. **Go to GamepadViewer**  
   - Open [GamepadViewer](https://gamepadviewer.com/) in your browser.  
   - Plug in or connect your Xbox controller (if itâ€™s not already connected).

4. **Select Your Controller**  
   - On the GamepadViewer page, click the gear icon (settings) in the top-right corner.  
   - Select **"Player 1"** or the controller you want to customize.

5. **Paste the PNG Link**  
   - Look for the field labeled **"Skin URL"** or **"Custom Skin"** (depending on the version of GamepadViewer).  
   - Paste the **direct link** (ending in `.png`) that you copied from this repository.

6. **Enjoy Your New Skin!**  
   - GamepadViewer will refresh and display your controller with the custom skin.  
   - You can repeat the process for other PNG skins in this repository to see which one you like best.

## Additional Tips

- **Transparency:** All PNG files support transparency, so the controller outline will look clean against any background.  
- **File Names:** Feel free to rename your skins if you want to keep them organized.  
- **Updates:** If you add new skins or modify existing ones, simply repeat the steps above to get the updated direct link.
