## Additional Tips

- **Transparency:** All PNG files support transparency, so the controller outline will look clean against any background.  
- **File Names:** Feel free to rename your skins if you want to keep them organized.  
- **Updates:** If you add new skins or modify existing ones, simply repeat the steps above to get the updated direct link.
